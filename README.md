# bashfuck
a small bash jail bypass - combine env variables to call any command with only 11 chars (no alphanum)

Bash is a very powerful shellscript-interpreter.

It has many environment variables. And we can do basic operator (+,-,*,/, concat, substr, ...) with variables.

So I just made a little fun to execute command without using alphanum characters.

There are 2 files that worked on macos and linux (ubuntu - in my case)

Change your command in source code (COMMAND = '-----')
